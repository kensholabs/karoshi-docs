Our hardcoding ethics follows the “wu-wei” principle of acting without deliberation in order to achieve the goals of the community. By applying this principle, we eliminate the risk of humans performing actions not aligned to the community values and purpose. The key to a truly successful DAO lies in the alignment of incentives. We believe in a conduct of behavior that is in harmony with the natural order of the Universe, the TAO.

## Why the TAO, Taoism and wu-wei?

> "The Tao is not something different from nature, from ourselves, from our surrounding trees and waters and air. The Tao is the way all that behaves. And so the basic Chinese idea of the universe is really that it’s an organism.” - Alan Watts

In Chinese philosophy, TAO means “the way” or “path” that is the eternal organizing force of all that is, the set of principles one must follow to be in sync with the natural order and realize the potential for individual wisdom and well-being. Nature is the most experienced master on how to survive and thrive, so we’re catching on!

The objective of Taoism is for a person to align harmoniously with the TAO. It teaches about genuineness, naturalness, simplicity, longevity, compassion, patience, immortality and wu-wei.

"Wu-wei" is translated from Chinese as non-action, natural action, effortless action, not-forcing, a perfect equilibrium with the TAO. "Wu-wei" is a state of passive mindfulness, where the mind does not engage in any subjective consideration or interference. That is, a person observes the situation noncommittally, free from biases, as it is. It is making decisions and action from a non-action state of mind, also known as “action without deliberation”. "Wu-wei" is a chance for mindful and balanced solutions not only for individual growth, but also for collective thriving.

We understand that the “wu-wei” state of mind is a powerful gift, yet not always achievable. Thus hardcoding ethics comes at play as a "proxy master" to act transparently on behalf of the community values and purpose. Besides, rather than treating ethical issues as secondary to the bedrock obligation to harvest profits even if laws are (profitably) broken and life is (profitably) destroyed, hardcoding ethics presents an opportunity to discuss whether “first, be lawful” or even “first, do no (net) harm” could, in at least some contexts, can be encoded as first principles.
