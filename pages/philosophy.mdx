KAROSHI DAO is a decentralized organization on the Solana blockchain founded with the mission to build products enabling new markets within the NFT economy. Through a lineup of core products, the DAO aims to empower users, creators, investors, brands, and degens of all kinds by tackling pain points like access to opportunities, capital efficiency, as well as UX and onboarding of NFT based products.

## What is a DAO?

A DAO, or “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” is entirely managed by its token holders, who participate in the planning, strategy and operations of the entity. The structure is fully transparent and has no central authority. The community members collectively define the foundational rules of the DAO, which are then executed by smart contracts. The proposals, decisions and voting data is posted on blockchain and is publicly visible.
