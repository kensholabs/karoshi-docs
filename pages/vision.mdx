# Vision and Values

KAROSHI is a space for collective creativity, where social interactions foster new interpretations, ideas, and discoveries. The community explores new ways to use art and technology to bring value and fresh experiences. We offer an environment that supports a culture of innovation. At KAROSHI, we believe that innovation is born at the point of tangency between opposite but complementary areas of expertise. Therefore, we embrace diversity in all its forms to let the magic happen and see the unseen. The diversity of our community will empower us to create clever solutions to modern problems collectively.<br></br>

To boost collective intelligence and generate creative ideas, we promote divergent, lateral, and associative thinking. Divergent thinking is spontaneous and non-linear, it can follow many lines of thought, and is free-flowing. Lateral thinking occurs in a manner of generating completely new perspectives or ideas that may seem disruptive at first, and with no obvious connection to the problem. Associative thinking integrates and recombines ideas that are opposed or seem unrelated in the beginning. The creative process leans on mutual respect, empathy, simplicity, and good intentions. Vision, not hierarchy, is what keeps us together.<br></br>

At KAROSHI, we care about the well-being of our community and are here to raise awareness of modern problems that affect us. One of them is the karoshi phenomenon. The chronic overwork and stress, sleep deprivation, and psychological exhaustion have become a worldwide disease. Although we canâ€™t stop the phenomenon, we are here to support creative initiatives in the fight for mental health. We see the future as a time of hope, and we make every effort to ensure that we can bring about that future together.
Last but not least, KAROSHI brings autonomy to the community by replacing the centralized overhead of a conventional business with code and automating the organizational flow. It facilitates simple and clear plans that are executed quickly and efficiently, rather than complex ones that take a long time to develop and implement.<br></br>

The DAO supports the community by providing real utilities and social perks, transparency with the aligned incentives with its token holders, and full IP rights to holders.
KAROSHI is truly owned and led by the community, and WAGMI for sure! The question is, are you going to build with us or are you going to FOMO into the next rug and blame the industry as a whole? We don't create jpegs, we create experiences. Let's add long-term value instead of short-term profits!
