KAROSHI DAO is a decentralized organization on the Solana blockchain founded with the mission to build products enabling new markets within the NFT economy. Through a lineup of core products, the DAO aims to empower users, creators, investors, brands, and degens of all kinds by tackling pain points like access to opportunities, capital efficiency, as well as UX and onboarding of NFT based products.

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Explained
A DAO, or a "Decentralized Autonomous Organization," is a completely decentralized entity managed by its token holders. They are involved in shaping the entity's plans, strategies, and operations. There is no central authority; instead, the structure is entirely transparent. The community collectively sets the basic rules of the DAO, which are then implemented via smart contracts. All proposals, decisions, and voting data are recorded on the blockchain and are publicly accessible.
