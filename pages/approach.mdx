# A pragmatic approach

While Kensho Labs is initiating KAROSHI, the DAO will be governed by its token holders. Kensho developers will function as an in-house team, employing agile/XP methodologies for product implementation.<br></br>

At KAROSHI, we employ Taoism principles to underscore two implications of integrating ethical rules into the organization's code. The first revolves around the central Taoist concept of "action without deliberation," while the second emphasizes transparent action in line with community values and objectives. In a broad sense, there are three ways ethics can be automated. Firstly, making certain actions mandatory – akin to “thou shalt.” Secondly, prohibiting unacceptable actions – or “thou shalt not.” Finally, requiring offsets where a detrimental action triggers a compensatory benefit, balancing the net harm to zero.<br></br>

This segues us into a short technical discussion on hardcoding ethics, prior to addressing entities that could potentially adopt this practice. Skepticism towards the credibility of blockchain-enabled applications by traditional corporations often arises due to centralized access and control – leadership can change the code, manipulate records, and control access. One straightforward solution is sharing access to at least one node with an independent, credible third-party, like a government regulatory agency, making illegitimate record alterations detectable. However, this somewhat undermines crypto's core principles of trustless and anonymous environments.<br></br>

In the end, multisig implementations exist, necessitating every party's signature for a transaction. In such cases, an attacker would need to compromise all signers, which, while theoretically possible, is highly improbable. The DAO ecosystem thrives on a unique blend of smart contracts and people who oversee on-chain and off-chain parameters. Even as algorithms and contracts establish the rules, DAO members must consistently vote on proposals and upgrades to ensure the organization stays true to its mission and vision.
