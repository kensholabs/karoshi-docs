## What is the purpose of the $ROSHI token?
$ROSHI is an SPL token. Those who possess this token can steer the network through staking their assets.
The $ROSHI token can be traded and stored in any wallet that supports the SPL token standard - ensuring global accessibility.
The $ROSHI token serves as a governance token for the KAROSHI DAO.

## What is the role of the $sROSHI token?
Contrary to most existing staking solutions, KAROSHI employs a dual token model to closely emulate the functions of the underlying blockchain network and to enhance the liquidity of user tokens.
Participants deposit their native PoS $ROSHI tokens into the smart contract to mint and receive an equivalent amount of sROSHI. These are 1:1 pegged SPL interest-bearing tokens, symbolizing staked tokens on the PoS network. Users can leverage sROSHI for participation/voting/proposing in the DAO or employ them to maximize yield in the DeFi ecosystem.
$sROSHI tokens represent staking rewards accumulated from $ROSHI. For instance, when participants stake $ROSHI, they can claim their staking rewards at any time, which are fully liquid. This allows users to either sell their rewards or restake them to compound their gains. These can be instantly converted back into the native token.
