## What is the duration of the vesting schedule?
Tokens assigned to the Founding team, Investors, Contributors, and Advisors are secured in a smart contract (utilizing Mean Finance) which gradually releases 2% of the tokens weekly over a span of one to two years (50-100 weeks). The vesting timeframe begins with the initiation of the Staking mechanism. Any remaining tokens designated for the presale and investors that are not sold will be transferred to the DAO treasury.
