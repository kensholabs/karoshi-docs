# How it works

In the initial phase, Kensho Labs has chosen to introduce the project as a DAO, dividing governance between the core team and community members. These members will actively contribute to and vote on the project's capitalization and progression.
With a robust background in conventional IT business, we have embraced the DAO and Web3 model to address the limitations of Web2 and to tap into the novel possibilities presented by a self-governing, decentralized setup. We've currently rooted ourselves in Europe and Asia, as the future of DAOs under U.S. regulations remains indeterminate.
We invite early investors and developers to partake in this venture, who will then utilize the platform for the creation of innovative tools and decentralized applications (dapps). Prior to the project's formal launch, a council comprising the boldest community members will be established to articulate community sentiments. This approach aims to expedite the project's development until the token is officially released. Meanwhile, all participants have the opportunity to propose ideas and vote on them. The council will identify and select the most compelling proposals.
Post-launch, the new token holders will be incorporated into the decision-making process. The number of tokens one holds will directly correspond to their stake in the DAO.
