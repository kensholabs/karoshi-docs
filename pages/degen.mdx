# What is a degen anyway?

There’s a lot of talk about “authentic” crypto culture, but what does that mean? It’s not just about being “true” to the technology or the ideology — it’s about being true to the people who created it. That means being true to the weird, eccentric, playful, and downright degenerate. The crypto world is full of characters: from the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, to Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, who once wore a shirt that said, “I am not Satoshi”. The people who have built this world are anything but boring! And that’s a good thing.<br></br>

The crypto world is a place for misfits, people who don’t fit into the traditional financial system. It’s a place for those who are fascinated by the power of technology and who want to use it to build something new. That’s why the crypto world is such a vibrant and interesting place. It’s full of people who are passionate about what they’re doing, and who are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible.<br></br>

The word "degen" is a combination of the words "degenerate" and "generation". It's used to describe a group of people who aren't afraid to be themselves and who aren't afraid to break the norms. The degen culture is also associated with a DIY (do it yourself) ethic because degens aren't afraid to experiment and try new things. This contrasts with the counterculture, which often relies on the approval of others. Although degeneracy can be seen as a negative thing, it doesn't have to be. Degeneracy can also be a positive force in society. For example, the subculture of punk rock was considered degenerate by many in the mainstream. Yet, punk rockers embraced their degenerate status and used it as a way to subvert the norm.<br></br>

If crypto has taught us anything, it's that we are all degens, whether we want to acknowledge it or not. Degen is not a community; degen is a way of life. Whether you are aping into this new hyped project, get rekt shorting the bottom on 100x leverage, or become a bag holder waiting for that lambo - you are truly a degen.<br></br>

Many think it's something exclusive to crypto, but the term “degenerate art” was used by the Nazi regime in Germany to describe virtually all modern art. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was non-German or Jewish Bolshevist in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being arrested and imprisoned.<br></br>

Modern degen culture is the underground culture that doesn't try to frame itself as something it's not. It is authentic with a sprinkle of meme-based humor. One important similarity with the Taoist way that we can learn from is not to fight creation and to choose the path of least resistance.<br></br>

Critics of the degen culture claim that it's driven by greed and that its members are more concerned with making money than with the technology itself; but if it were so, we would all be bankers. As all people do, we might be weak, biased, and make the same mistake multiple times; but if anything - we learn and remain true to ourselves because apes are strong!<br></br>

We believe that this authenticity brought us to crypto in the first place, and even though we faced a lot of scammers, we made true friends along the way. This culture is one of the things that makes the cryptocurrency community so special. It is a community that is not afraid to be itself, and it is a community that is not afraid to show the world what it truly is about.
