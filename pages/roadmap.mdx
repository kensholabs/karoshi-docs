# Roadmap

![](/rdm.webp)

In this space everyone screams UTILITY and community and then lays off a shitty bullet point roadmap that no one needs. If you have 200 things on there, it's not a roadmap, it's a wishlist! Why? It’s PR and marketing. Their only purpose is to sell people on the idea of the project rather than the project itself. Why can’t we just show people what we’re building? Why can’t we just tell people how awesome our idea is and how we’re going to build it? Why does everything have to be so effin' shady and secretive? Is it because they’re all a bunch of scammers? Is it because all these projects are just a pile of shit? Is it because they have no effin' clue of what they're doing? Maybe all three? We just know that we're tired of all this bullshit, the lies, deception and empty promises.

Do they really care about community? It's easy to copy the last working project, bring nothing new to the table and label bullshit as utility, but who wants that? We've seen okay roadmaps, then copycat roadmaps, then memes and no roadmaps. Did they succeed? Mostly no! This created a precedent where, when you hear utility, you automatically want to turn the other way and leave. We've decided to take a different approach. At the core, we are developers, artists, music producers and much more. We've created a framework for proposals and voting, and we're going to vote on the best ideas and build them. Providing real value is what this space needs. This is how it should be done, this is how we do it! Otherwise, you're NGMI.

The community members will choose representatives who've proven their loyalty to the community by directly participating in the process, increasing the transparency, accountability and doing things the right way.
We will write some viable paths we want to pursue, but in the end, we will all decide what's best and how we'll do it!
