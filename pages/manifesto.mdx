# Manifesto
If you do not fear death,
then how can they intimidate you?
If you aren't afraid of dying,
there is nothing you cannot do.
Not-knowing is true knowledge.
Presuming to know is a disease.
Failure is an opportunity.
If you blame someone else,
there is no end to the blame.
If you overly esteem talented individuals,
people will become overly competitive.
If you overvalue possessions,
people will begin to steal.
Do not display your treasures
or people will become envious.
The Master leads by
emptying people's minds;
filling their bellies,
weakening their ambitions,
and making them become strong.
Forget about knowledge and wisdom,
and people will be a hundred times better off.
Throw away charity and righteousness,
and people will return to brotherly love.
Throw away profit and greed,
and there won't be any thieves.
Preferring simplicity and freedom from desires,
avoiding the pitfalls of knowledge and wrong action.
For those who practice not-doing,
everything will fall into place.
Embrace simplicity.
Put others first.
Desire little.
> mostly "Lao Tzu"
