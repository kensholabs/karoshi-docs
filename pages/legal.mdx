THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OR AN INVITATION TO BUY TOKENS. IT INCLUDES THEORETICAL, PROSPECTIVE, AND/OR ESTIMATED FIGURES THAT ARE NOT GUARANTEED, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR ACTUAL NUMBERS TO DIFFER. KAROSHI DOES NOT GUARANTEE OR ASSURE THE COMPLETENESS OR CORRECTNESS OF THIS INFORMATION, AND IT MAY BE ALTERED WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING.

ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS SPECIFIC TO CERTAIN COUNTRIES, THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF $ROSHI TOKENS ARE NOT PERMITTED FOR U.S. RESIDENTS AND CITIZENS.

The $ROSHI Token, issued by KAROSHI DAO, should not be considered as an investment or a security. Other cryptocurrencies or tokens may be considered securities or may be designed to possess the attributes of securities, offering or intending to deliver a return comparable to that expected by equity investors. The $ROSHI Token does not fall into this category. It is expected that users will buy and retain $ROSHI to gain exclusive membership benefits or similar. The $ROSHI Token does not establish or impose any enforceable contractual or other responsibilities on the DAO.

Consequently, the user acknowledges that the $ROSHI does not, and should not be interpreted to, provide the user with any licensing or rights relating to any intellectual property rights, publicity rights, or equivalent rights associated with the DAO or any of its affiliates. The user acknowledges that the DAO retains the authority to introduce or withdraw Token Functionalities at their sole discretion at any time.

Given that the implementation of Token Functionalities by the DAO is not assured, the user understands that the $ROSHI may not offer the user any Token Functionalities whatsoever. Furthermore, users should only acquire tokens in quantities they anticipate using in the foreseeable future.
