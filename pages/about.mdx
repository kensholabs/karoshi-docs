# About KAROSHI

KAROSHI is a forward-thinking, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the tenets of innovation, transparency, and inclusivity. Pioneering the fusion of blockchain, AI and ethical hardcoding, KAROSHI is redefining the way DAOs operate, prioritizing the value of community participation over centralized control.

The heart of KAROSHI lies in its DAO members, the driving force behind the DAO's rule. To ensure the system's transparent functioning and uphold the community's values and purpose, KAROSHI operates with a team of dedicated in-house developers following agile/XP methodologies.

In a world increasingly converging with technology, KAROSHI employs a unique synergy of smart contracts and human inputs to regulate on-chain and off-chain parameters. Through regular voting on proposals and upgrades, members of KAROSHI contribute directly to the DAO's mission and vision. It's a testament to KAROSHI's commitment to creating a community-driven platform where technology serves people, not profits.

In an industry often fraught with uncertainty, KAROSHI stands out as a beacon of reliability and ethical practice. The principles of Taoism deeply influence KAROSHI's approach, emphasizing action without deliberation and transparency on behalf of community values.

KAROSHI is not just a DAO; it's a global movement aimed at revolutionizing the digital landscape by placing power back into the hands of its users. The authentic ethos of KAROSHI resonates within its community, creating a vibrant and diverse environment that celebrates the eccentricity and individuality of its members.
